Section 15: Adding Client side attendances
206. Section 15 introduction

207. Adding attendees to our list items
- Create a new activity list Item attendees cmp and list the attendees there
- Popup is the same as popover in material

208. Adding attendees to the Detailed view sidebar
- configure activityDetailedSidebar to use attendeeList

209. Adding the IsGoing and IsHost properties to the Activityinterface
- extend fronted iactivity interface with isgoing and isHost
- set the new props inside activity store, using (from) the attendees list
- refactor acitvitylist item to show is going and isHost. Added images and dispalyNames

210. Conditionally rendering the activity detailed headerbuttons
- show the join, cancel and manage buttons depending on the user

211. Adding the cancel attendance function
- crateattendee -> move the function to the util file so we can reuse it later
- add attendActivity method to activityStore
- add cancelAttendance method to activity store
- do not forget to add observer to activity detail sidebar (but in general)

212. Hooking it all up to the API
- add to agent.ts: attend: (id: string) => request.post(`/activities/${id}/attend`, {}),
- add a new observable to activityStore: @observable loading = false;
- hook up the apis for attend and unattend. Use runInAction methods after async method!!!

213. Loose ends
- we need to set the isHost prop for the newly created user as we don't fetch it from api after creation (createActivity in activityStore)

214. Summary of section 15
- adding attendences to client
