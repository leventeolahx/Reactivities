Section 10: Error handling and validation
120. Section 10 introduction

121. Introduction to validation in the API
- One way to implement validation to introduce data annotations
- Other way for validation is to use fluent validation
- Fluent validation is a package

122. Adding validation in the Api using Data Annotations
- launch.json .NET Core Attach - for debugging the api
- debug tab in vs code -> select .net code attach
- run the debug by clicking on the green button and select the api.exe or dll
- validations are stored in the ModalState while debugging
- fluent validation acts as a middleware between our command and the handler

123. Adding validation in the Api using Fluent Validation
- quite common practice to use fluent validation when using MediatR
- Add FluentValidation.AspNetCore to application project
- add netcoreapp3.0 for all projects to can use fluent validation, because that package uses netcoreapp3.0
- dotnet restore
- public class CommandValidation : AbstractValidator<Command> class and create a constructor. There you can add RuleFor
-.AddFluentValidation(cfg => cfg.RegisterValidatorsFromAssemblyContaining<Create>() - add this line to the startup project after addControllers
- we only need to specify one particular class because this method is going to look for any validators and register them in our services

143. Error handling concepts in our application
- 2xx - ok, 3xx - not modified/ redirected, 4xx - client side error, 5xx - server side error
- we have no access to the httpResponse in the application project
- this case the only way to get out of a request from the application project to the api is to throw an exception with proper message
- to have access to httpContext and one way to access this context is to create a exception handling middleware
- ordering of middleware is important as aspCore executes the middleware in the pipeline one after another
- when it comes to exception handling we need to call it early in the pipeline so that we can catch exceptions that occur in later stages of the pipeline

125. Error handling strategy
- in the value controller we can return Notfound cause we are inside of an APIController
- there is two schools of thought on how to handler errors from MediatR handler
- one of them is to always return back a result object to the a API Controller and in that result obj we can include the error
- exceptions are a bit more expensive
- the other on is to use exception and stop the execution of the handler
- and we are going to intercept the exception and turn that into an http response

126. Creating a derived Exception class for Rest exceptions
- right now in development mode we send back an exception page (startup.cs -> app.UserDeveloperExceptionPage)
- api->properties->launchSettings.json -> api.aspnetcode_env -> to prod -> this changes the environment to production
- Create a new class which inherits from exception (RestException)
- add httpStatus code and error to the constructor

127. Adding Error handling middleware
- aspnetcore middleware
- create an errorHandlingMiddleware class
- add a `RequestDelegate next` param to the constructor
- add an Invoke method with a httpContext param and add `await _next(context)` - if it's okay then it will execute the next middleware
- if the invoke fails then we catch it in the exception and handling every type of ex in a new method (RestException, Exception atm)
- JsonSerializer is included in v2 of .net framework
- add values to context.response : statusCode, contentType, response.Write
- context.Response.StatusCode = (int)re.Code;                     
- context.Response.ContentType = "application/json";
- await context.Response.WriteAsync(JsonSerializer.Serialize(new {errors}));

128. Using our Error handling middleware
- add the middleware to the startup at the beginning of the config method: app.UseMiddleware<ErrorHandlingMiddleware>();

129. Using Axios interceptors to catch errors
- we can add an interceptor to the agent.ts file and we can intercept either the request or response
- axios.interceptors.response.use
- create a new cmp not found and redirect user there in case of 404
- Switch cmp from react router to show only one router at once

130. Throwing errors in the client
- at the moment we have no access to routing functionality inside axios agent file
- throw error in agent when it's 404
- throw the error again in the activity store and catch it in the activity detail where we have access to route params
- would be better to redirect the user inside the interceptor

131. Adding routing functionality to Axios
- import { Router } from 'react-router-dom'
- import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history' in index. tsx and refactor BrowseRouter
- export const history = createBrowserHistory(); - and add this history to the Router
- use the newly created history const in agent.ts

132. Handling and individual GUID on a get request
- if (status === 400 && config.method === 'get' && data.errors.hasOwnProperty('id')) - check for guid validation

133. Adding toast notifications
 - npm install react-toastify
- import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.min.css'; - index.tsx
- <ToastContainer position='bottom-right'/> - to app.tsx

134. Handling network errors in Axios
-  if (error.message === 'Network Error' && !error.status)
- dotnet ef database drop -p Persistence/ -s APi/    -> drop db to clear it
