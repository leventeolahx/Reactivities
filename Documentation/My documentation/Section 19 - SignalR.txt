Section 19: SignalR
247. Section 19 Introduction
- SignalR: add real-time web functionality to apps
- Connected clients receive content instantly

248. Adding the Comment entity
- create comment entity, add virtual so lazy loading will load automatically
- dotnet ef migrations add "AddedCommentEntity" -p Persistence/ -s API/

249. Adding the Comment DTO and mapping
- create a new dto commentDto, use autoMapper to map comment to commentDto
- create mapping profile in comments folder (application proj)

250. Adding the Create comment handler
- create a command handler for create comment
- we need to parse Username in the command as we cannot use userAccessor here
- signalR is using WebSocket instead of http. UserAccessor is accessible through httpContext

251. Adding a SignalR hub
- services.AddSignalR(); - startUp.cs. This is gonna provide the routing
- signalR is gonna act like an endpoint
- endpoints.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chat"); - configure signalR endpoints in configure method (startUp.cs)
- whenever a request come in the chat endpoint the program will redirect to the chatHub
- Create SignalR folder in api and add chatHub c# file
- chatHub inherits from Hub, bring mediator in the constructor
- in signalR the name of the method is used in client app, in this case SendComment
- our client invokes the SendComment, which then goes ahead and send our command to our mediator
- the comment are saved to the db and returned from mediator handler
- the comment is sent to all of the client which is connected to our hub

252. Configuring Auth for SignalR
- configure context for signalR. Add a new opt.Event to JwtBearer in startup.cs
- we want to hook into the onMessageReceive
- get the access token from the request Query
- get the context path and check the access token and the path
- set context.Token = accessToken - signalR has no auth param. the token is sent in access_token param and we need to set the token here

253. Adding the SignalR hub connection to the client
- npm install @microsoft/signalr
- @observable.ref hubConnection: HubConnection | null = null;
- @observable.ref - only gonna observe a reference to the object and don't observe all the properties
- createHubConnection - action in activityStore
- this.hubConnection = new HubConnectionBuilder() - initialize on the chat endpoint
- withUrl('http://localhost:5000/chat') - we need to parse some options, like the access token, access_token will be sent as a query param
- we need to send the access token like this, as in a normal http request we send it in the header, but signalR does not use http, it uses webSocket
- configure logging and build the connection
- this.hubConnection.start() - start the hub connection
- this.hubConnection.on('ReceiveComment', comment => {}); - this is invoked when the ReceiveComment is invoked
- ReceiveComment - we defined it earlier in the backend when call Clients.All.Send
- Add stopHubConnection action with this.hubConnection!.stop();

254. Connecting to the SignalR hub from our client
- create addComment action with await this.hubConnection.invoke("SendComment", values) - invoke a method with a specific name on the server
- Invoke('SendComment') - need to match with the name of the method that is in the chatHub
- ActivityDetailedChat: in use effect  createHubConnection and stopHubConnection
- we need to add .AllowCredentials() to CorsPolicy in StartUp.cs

255. Adding the Comment functionality to the client
- create a final form in activityDetailedChat.tsx

256. Formatting Dates in words using Date-FNS
- {formatDistance(comment.createdAt, new Date())

257. Using SignalR Groups in the API
- Add addToGroup and RemoveFromGroup ChatHub methods. Also change Clients.All to Clients.Group(activityId). 
- When a user open the activity we invoke AddToGroup. When leaves it we invoke RemoveFromGroup

258. Using SignalR Groups in the client
- this.hubConnection!.invoke('AddToGroup', activityId) - invoke when the hubConnection is started
- this.hubConnection.on('Send', message => {}) - invoke a new method to show toast when a user enters the activity/ chat
- this.hubConnection!.invoke('RemoveFromGroup', this.activity!.id) - onStopConnection. In Then chain method stop the connection after the user is removed

259. Section 19 summary
- What is SignalR?
- ASPNET Core SignalR
- @aspnet/signalr
