Section 16: Photo Upload Part 1 - API
215. Section 16 introduction
Options to store files:
- db: it's not good practice to store files in db: inefficient, take to much space from db (disk space issue)
- file system: same disk space issue
- cloud service: scalable, expensive, secured with api key

216. Cloudinary settings
- https://cloudinary.com - create a new account and use the free plan
- dotnet user-secrets set "Cloudinary:CloudName" "your key"
- create a new photos folder to infrastructure project and create a cloudinarySettings file with the key that we previously added to user-secretes
- services.Configure<CloudinarySettings>(Configuration.GetSection("Cloudinary"); - Configuration has access to userSecrets, appSettings config etc.
- We used 'Cloudinary:' when we set the user secrets and this way we can access it as Configuration.GetSection
- install CloudinaryDotNet to infrastructure proj

217. Adding the interface and class for our Photo Accessor
- create new IPhotoAccessor interface
- Create new folder Photos in application proj
- Move PhotoUploadResult to Photos Folder
- IPhotoAccessor has atm two methods: AddPhoto and DeletePhoto - both will be handled in infrastructure proj and will have their own return type
- Create the actual class of IPhotoAccessor in infrastructure proj called: PhotoAccessor, and implement that interface
- services.AddScoped<IPhotoAccessor, PhotoAccessor>(); - add it to the startup.cs so that we can insert to the app when we need to

218. Adding the AddPhoto handler
- create a new _cloudinary private prop and initialize it in the constructor
- Inject public PhotoAccessor(IOptions<CloudinarySettings> config) to use config.Value.APIKey 
- the Cloudinary setting is set up in the startUp to be a config and dependency injection will take care of it
- extend AddPhoto method: - openReadStream, create uploadParams, upload file to cloudinary, user uploadResult

219. Adding the Domain Entity
- Add a new entity Photo, virtual ICollection<Photo> photos to appUser
- cuz user - photos is a one to many-to-many relationship and we've defined the Photos prop inside appUser we don't need to provide additional config
- dotnet ef migrations add "PhotoEntityAdded" -p Persistence/ -s Api/

220. Adding the Add Photo Handler
- add Photo.Add handler
- add to command: public IFormFile File { get; set; } - aspNetCore.Http
- inject: IUserAccessor, IPhotoAccessor
- create the photo using accessor, get the user from context using accessor, create photo object and save it

221. Adding the Photo API Controller
- Create a new PhotosController and inherit from base controller
- add photo api
- instead of sending json text in the body, we send as form-data
- add [FromForm] to api method so api will know where to locate the file
- Transformation = new Transformation().Height(500).Width(500).Crop("fill").Gravity("face") - cloudinary is able to crop images

222. Adding User Profiles feature
- Create a new folder and c# file: Profiles.cs
- Create detail handler in application proj inside Profiles
- Create a new ProfilesController

223. Adding the Delete photo handler
- Extend delete photo in photo accessor, user deletionParams, and Cloudinary.destroy. return "ok" or null
- Create the delete handler. Get user, and photo. Delete photo using PhotoAccessor. Check result. Remove photo user. 
- add delete api to photos controller

224. Adding the set main photo functionality
- Add setMain photo mediator handler. Call it in api

225. Adding the Mapping Profile configuration for User images
- add Image = user.Photos.FirstOrDefault(x => x.IsMain)?.Url, to register, login, current user and attendees

226. Summary of section 16
- cloudinary storage
- add photo accessor
- upload/ set/ delete photos
